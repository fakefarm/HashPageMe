# TODO

- Webmock - not necessary
- VCR
- what is webmock all about?
- setting up vcr
-

# Question - am i using minitest or testunit in rails? It almost seems like i can use either

## Homework

0. read up on mocha
1. Mock things out using mocha to make sure tests pass
2. Learn cucumber
3. 

### Types of test

#### controller (functional?) / integration tests

_Controller tests shouldn't have to hit the interenet_

- stubs here
- start with vcr but no usually necessary.

#### unit

#### acceptance tests (not done so much at ls)
- vcr here in a perfect work
- capybara or cucumber
